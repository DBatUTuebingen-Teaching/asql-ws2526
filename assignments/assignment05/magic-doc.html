      <h1>Magic the Gathering Card Deck by <a href="https://mtgjson.com/">MTGJSON</a></h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Magic the Gathering is a collectible card game. Each player has their
        own deck of cards. In game play, they build their deck out of at least
        60 cards. New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion
        sets. All cards belong either to the base sets or some expansion or
        compilation set.</p>
    </div>
    <div><a name="allcards"></a>
      <h2>magic-cards.json</h2>
      <p>The <strong>magic-cards.json</strong> file is organized by card name and
        merges card data from multiple sets into a single card object.<br><br>
        Due to this merging of card data, several set specific fields are
        not present in the cards data, <i>e.g.</i>, <TT>artist, border, flavor,
          foreignNames, id, mciNumber, multiverseid, number, originalText,
          originalType, rarity, releaseDate, reserved, timeshifted, variations,
          watermark</TT> etc.<br><br>
        This file is lighter weight and is meant to provide a quick and easy way
        to get basic card data. (In case you don't find your favourite Magic
        card, sorry, this data set is not very up to date.)<br><br>
        The JSON file itself looks like this:<br></p>
      <pre><code data-language="javascript">{
...
      "Nevinyrral's Disk" : { /* card data */ },
                 "Norrit" : { /* card data */ },
"Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius" : { /* card data */ },
...
}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div><a name="cards"></a>
      <h2>Cards</h2>
      <p>
        The card data is a JSON object with key/value pairs. Below you will find
        a table detailing each key.
